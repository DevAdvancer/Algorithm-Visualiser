# Algorithm Visualiser

## Overview

The Algorithm Visualiser is an interactive tool designed to help users understand and visualize various algorithms through graphical representations. It aims to provide a clear and engaging way to learn algorithms, making it easier for students, educators, and enthusiasts to grasp complex concepts.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Visualize algorithms in real-time as they execute, allowing users to see how data structures change over time.
- **Support for Multiple Algorithms**: Includes a variety of algorithms such as sorting algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort), searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search), and graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A modern and intuitive UI that enhances user experience and engagement.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Users can step through the execution of algorithms to understand each phase of the process.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust input parameters to see how different values affect algorithm performance and behavior.

## Installation

To set up the Algorithm Visualiser on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithm-visualiser.git
   cd algorithm-visualiser
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
